<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The most frustrating type of “food wishes” I get are the ones asking if I can make a specific dish from a specific restaurant. They usually start off with something like, “I just had the Chicken Fantasia at Pete’s Eats in Salt Lake City and loved it! Can you please show me how to make it?” I’d email back something like, “I’d love to, but since I’ve never been to Pete’s Eats, or Salt Lake City, except for a 30 minute bus stop in 1983, I can’t.” 
    I want to, but unfortunately I can’t.</p>
